Pandas Homework where I create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze schools and standardized test data

Summary Findings:
1) Scores by School Spending results show that schools with lower spending budgets per student tend to outperform those with the highest spending budgets per student. The differences are quite significant (i.e. from 90% overall passing rate to 53% overall passing rate between the lowest and highest spending ranges respectively).

2) Scores by School Size results show that there isn't much of a gap in overall passing rates between small and medium schools (i.e. 89% vs 90%) but there is a significant decline in overall passing rates at large schools whereby they showed 58%. The major contributor to this gap is the poor pass rates in math for large schools.

3) Scores by School Type results show that Charter schools outperform District schools in both reading and math scores and the overall passing rate is significantly different (i.e. 90% for Charter schools vs 53% for District schools)
